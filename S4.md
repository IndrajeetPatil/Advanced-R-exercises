# S4



### Exercises 15.2.1

**Q1.** `lubridate::period()` returns an S4 class. What slots does it have? What class is each slot? What accessors does it provide?

**Q2.** What other ways can you find help for a method? Read `?"?"` and summarise the details.

### Exercises 15.3.6

**Q1.** Extend the Person class with fields to match `utils::person()`. Think about what slots you will need, what class each slot should have, and what you'll need to check in your validity method.

**Q2.** What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn't have any slots? (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.)

**Q3.** Imagine you were going to reimplement factors, dates, and data frames in S4. Sketch out the `setClass()` calls that you would use to define the classes. Think about appropriate `slots` and `prototype`.

### Exercises 15.4.5

**Q1.** Add `age()` accessors for the `Person` class.

**Q2.** In the definition of the generic, why is it necessary to repeat the name of the generic twice?

**Q3.** Why does the `show()` method defined in Section [Show method](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html#show-method) use `is(object)[[1]]`? (Hint: try printing the employee subclass.)

**Q4.** What happens if you define a method with different argument names to the generic?

### Exercises 15.5.5

**Q1.** Draw the method graph for `f(`ðŸ˜…, ðŸ˜½`)`.

**Q2.** Draw the method graph for `f(`ðŸ˜ƒ, ðŸ˜‰, ðŸ˜™`)`.

**Q3.** Take the last example which shows multiple dispatch over two classes that use multiple inheritance. What happens if you define a method for all terminal classes? Why does method dispatch not save us much work here?

### Exercises 15.6.3

**Q1.** What would a full `setOldClass()` definition look like for an ordered factor (i.e. add `slots` and `prototype` the definition above)?

**Q2.** Define a `length` method for the `Person` class.
