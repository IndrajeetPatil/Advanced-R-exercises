My solutions to exercises from the _Advanced R_ (2nd Edition) [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). 

Note that you **should be** reading the [official solutions manual](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/index.html), which has more detailed explanations and are guaranteed to have correct solutions as the original author was also involved in writing them. I provide no such guarantees. ðŸ˜¬
