My solutions to exercises from Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R_ (2nd edition) [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

Driven by the urge to solve all book exercises independently to test my own understanding, I started building this solution manual. But, as I was consulting the [official solutions manual](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/index.html) to check my solutions, I realized that some of the solutions were quite different. I thought this was good, because if readers of the official manual find any of the answers unsatisfactory, they would have another resource to consult with. 

Although I have tried to make sure that all solutions are correct, the blame for any inaccuracies lies solely with me. I'd very much appreciate any suggestions or corrections.
