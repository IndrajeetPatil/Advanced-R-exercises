- [Official solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/index.html)

Note that you **should be** reading the official solutions manual, which somtimes have more detailed explanations and are guaranteed to have correct solutions as the original author was also involved in writing them. I provide no such guarantees. ðŸ˜¬
