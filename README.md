This book provides solutions to exercises from Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R_ (2nd edition) [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

I started working on this book as part of my process to learn by solving each of the book's exercises. When I compared my solutions to the [official solutions manual](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/index.html), I realized that many of my solutions took different approaches or were at least explained differently. I'm sharing this book in case others might find another perspective or explanation than the official solution manual helpful for building understanding.

Although I have tried to make sure that all solutions are correct, the blame for any inaccuracies lies solely with me. I'd very much appreciate [any suggestions or corrections](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/Advanced-R-exercises/issues).
