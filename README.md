This book provides solutions to exercises from Hadley Wickham's _Advanced R_ (2nd edition) [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

Driven by the urge to solve all book exercises independently to test my own understanding, I started building this solution manual. But, while consulting the [official solutions manual](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/index.html) to check correctness of my solutions, I realized that many of the solutions were quite different, or were similar but explained in a different manner. Thinking that if readers of the official manual found any of the answers unsatisfactory or unclear, they would have another resource to consult with, I decided to publish this as an online book.

Although I have tried to make sure that all solutions are correct, the blame for any inaccuracies lies solely with me. I'd very much appreciate [any suggestions or corrections](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/Advanced-R-exercises/issues).
