# Measuring performance



## Exercises 23.2.4

**Q1.** Profile the following function with `torture = TRUE`. What is surprising? Read the source code of `rm()` to figure out what's going on.


```r
f <- function(n = 1e5) {
  x <- rep(1, n)
  rm(x)
}
```

**A1.** 

Let's first source the functions mentioned in exercises.


```r
library(profvis)

source("profiling-exercises.R")
```

First, we try without `torture = TRUE`: it returns no meaningful results. 


```r
profvis(f())
#> Error in parse_rprof(prof_output, expr_source): No parsing data available. Maybe your function was too fast?
```

Maybe because the function runs too fast?


```r
bench::mark(f(), check = FALSE, iterations = 1000)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 6
#>   expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
#>   <bch:expr> <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
#> 1 f()           102µs    148µs     6271.     792KB     95.5
```

As mentioned in the docs, setting `torture = TRUE`

> Triggers garbage collection after every torture memory allocation call.

This process somehow never seems to finish and crashes the RStudio session when it stops!


```r
profvis(f(), torture = TRUE)
```

The question says that documentation for `rm()` may provide clues:


```r
rm
#> function (..., list = character(), pos = -1, envir = as.environment(pos), 
#>     inherits = FALSE) 
#> {
#>     dots <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$...
#>     if (length(dots) && !all(vapply(dots, function(x) is.symbol(x) || 
#>         is.character(x), NA, USE.NAMES = FALSE))) 
#>         stop("... must contain names or character strings")
#>     names <- vapply(dots, as.character, "")
#>     if (length(names) == 0L) 
#>         names <- character()
#>     list <- .Primitive("c")(list, names)
#>     .Internal(remove(list, envir, inherits))
#> }
#> <bytecode: 0x107958ab8>
#> <environment: namespace:base>
```

I still couldn't figure out why. I would recommend checking out the [official answer](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/measuring-performance.html#profiling).

## Exercises 23.3.3

**Q1.** Instead of using `bench::mark()`, you could use the built-in function `system.time()`. But `system.time()` is much less precise, so you'll need to repeat each operation many times with a loop, and then divide to find the average time of each operation, as in the code below.


```r
n <- 1e6
system.time(for (i in 1:n) sqrt(x)) / n
system.time(for (i in 1:n) x^0.5) / n
```
    
How do the estimates from `system.time()` compare to those from `bench::mark()`? Why are they different?

**A1.** 


```r
library(dplyr)

n <- 1e6
x <- runif(100)

# bench -------------------

bench_df <- bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x^0.5,
  iterations = n
)

t_bench_df <- bench_df %>%
  dplyr::select(expression, time) %>%
  dplyr::rowwise() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(mean = mean(unlist(time))) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(-time)

# system.time -------------------

# garbage collection performed immediately before the timing
t1_systime_gc <- system.time(for (i in 1:n) sqrt(x), gcFirst = TRUE) / n
t2_systime_gc <- system.time(for (i in 1:n) x^0.5, gcFirst = TRUE) / n

# garbage collection not performed immediately before the timing
t1_systime_nogc <- system.time(for (i in 1:n) sqrt(x), gcFirst = FALSE) / n
t2_systime_nogc <- system.time(for (i in 1:n) x^0.5, gcFirst = FALSE) / n

t_systime_df <- tibble(
  "expression" = bench_df$expression,
  "systime_with_gc_us" = c(t1_systime_gc["elapsed"], t2_systime_gc["elapsed"]),
  "systime_with_nogc_us" = c(t1_systime_nogc["elapsed"], t2_systime_nogc["elapsed"])
) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    systime_with_gc_us = systime_with_gc_us * 1e6,
    systime_with_nogc_us = systime_with_nogc_us * 1e6
  )
```

Compare results from these alternatives:


```r
t_bench_df
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   expression     mean
#>   <bch:expr> <bch:tm>
#> 1 sqrt(x)    426.34ns
#> 2 x^0.5        1.31µs

t_systime_df
#> # A tibble: 2 × 3
#>   expression systime_with_gc_us systime_with_nogc_us
#>   <bch:expr>              <dbl>                <dbl>
#> 1 sqrt(x)                 0.399                0.425
#> 2 x^0.5                   1.22                 1.24
```

The comparison reveals that these two approaches yield quite similar results.

**Q2.** Here are two other ways to compute the square root of a vector. Which do you think will be fastest? Which will be slowest? Use microbenchmarking to test your answers.


```r
x^(1 / 2)
exp(log(x) / 2)
```

**A2.**

Microbenchmarking all ways to compute square root of a vector mentioned in this chapter.


```r
x <- runif(1000)

bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x^0.5,
  x^(1 / 2),
  exp(log(x) / 2),
  iterations = 1000
) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(median)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 6
#>   expression         min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc
#>   <bch:expr>    <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>
#> 1 sqrt(x)         1.02µs   1.89µs   565479.    7.86KB
#> 2 exp(log(x)/2)   6.15µs   7.13µs   141504.    7.86KB
#> 3 x^0.5           9.22µs   9.66µs   100562.    7.86KB
#> 4 x^(1/2)         9.27µs  10.29µs    97725.    7.86KB
#>   `gc/sec`
#>      <dbl>
#> 1        0
#> 2        0
#> 3        0
#> 4        0
```

The specialized primitive function `sqrt()` (written in `C`) is the fastest way to compute square root.
