# R6

## Exercise 14.2.6 

### Q1. R6 class for bank account {-}

Create the superclass and make sure it works as expected.


```r
library(R6)

# define the needed class
bankAccount <- R6::R6Class(
  "bankAccount",
  public = list(
    # fields -----------------------
    balance = NA,
    name = NA,

    # methods ----------------------
    initialize = function(name = NULL, balance) {
      self$validate(balance)

      self$name <- name
      self$balance <- balance
    },
    deposit = function(amount) {
      self$validate(amount)
      cat("Current balance is: ", self$balance, "\n", sep = "")
      cat("And you are depositing: ", amount)
      self$balance <- self$balance + amount
      invisible(self)
    },
    withdraw = function(amount) {
      self$validate(amount)
      cat("Current balance is: ", self$balance, "\n", sep = "")
      cat("And you are withdrawing: ", amount, "\n", sep = "")
      self$balance <- self$balance - amount
      invisible(self)
    },
    validate = function(amount) {
      stopifnot(is.numeric(amount), amount >= 0)
    },
    print = function() {
      cat("Dear ", self$name, ", your balance is: ", self$balance, sep = "")
      invisible(self)
    }
  )
)

# create an instance of an object
indra <- bankAccount$new(name = "Indra", balance = 100)

indra
#> Dear Indra, your balance is: 100

# do deposits and withdrawals to see if the balance changes
indra$deposit(20)
#> Current balance is: 100
#> And you are depositing:  20

indra
#> Dear Indra, your balance is: 120

indra$withdraw(10)
#> Current balance is: 120
#> And you are withdrawing: 10

indra
#> Dear Indra, your balance is: 110

# make sure input validation checks work
indra$deposit(-20)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
indra$deposit("pizza")
#> Error in self$validate(amount): is.numeric(amount) is not TRUE
indra$withdraw(-54)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
Anne <- bankAccount$new(name = "Anne", balance = -45)
#> Error in self$validate(balance): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
```

Create a subclass that errors if you attempt to overdraw


```r
bankAccountStrict <- R6::R6Class(
  "bankAccountStrict",
  inherit = bankAccount,
  public = list(
    withdraw = function(amount) {
      # use method from superclass
      super$withdraw(amount)

      if (self$balance < 0) {
        invisible(self)
        stop(
          cat("\nYou are trying to withdraw more that your balance.\n"),
          cat("I'm sorry, ", self$name, ", I'm afraid I can't do that.", sep = ""),
          call. = FALSE
        )
      }
    }
  )
)

# create an instance of an object
Pritesh <- bankAccountStrict$new(name = "Pritesh", balance = 100)

Pritesh
#> Dear Pritesh, your balance is: 100

# do deposits and withdrawals to see if the balance changes
Pritesh$deposit(20)
#> Current balance is: 100
#> And you are depositing:  20

Pritesh
#> Dear Pritesh, your balance is: 120

Pritesh$withdraw(150)
#> Current balance is: 120
#> And you are withdrawing: 150
#> 
#> You are trying to withdraw more that your balance.
#> I'm sorry, Pritesh, I'm afraid I can't do that.
#> Error:

Pritesh
#> Dear Pritesh, your balance is: -30

# make sure input validation checks work
Pritesh$deposit(-20)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
Pritesh$deposit("pizza")
#> Error in self$validate(amount): is.numeric(amount) is not TRUE
Pritesh$withdraw(-54)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
Pritesh <- bankAccountStrict$new(name = "Pritesh", balance = -45)
#> Error in self$validate(balance): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
```

Create a subclass that charges a fee if overdraw


```r
bankAccountFee <- R6::R6Class(
  "bankAccountFee",
  inherit = bankAccount,
  public = list(
    withdraw = function(amount) {
      # use method from superclass
      super$withdraw(amount)
      
      if (self$balance < 0) {
        cat("\nI am charging you 10 euros for overdrawing.\n")
        self$balance = self$balance - 10
        invisible(self)
      }
    }
  )
)

# create an instance of an object
Mangesh <- bankAccountFee$new(name = "Mangesh", balance = 100)

Mangesh
#> Dear Mangesh, your balance is: 100

# do deposits and withdrawals to see if the balance changes
Mangesh$deposit(20)
#> Current balance is: 100
#> And you are depositing:  20

Mangesh
#> Dear Mangesh, your balance is: 120

Mangesh$withdraw(150)
#> Current balance is: 120
#> And you are withdrawing: 150
#> 
#> I am charging you 10 euros for overdrawing.

Mangesh
#> Dear Mangesh, your balance is: -40

# make sure input validation checks work
Mangesh$deposit(-20)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
Mangesh$deposit("pizza")
#> Error in self$validate(amount): is.numeric(amount) is not TRUE
Mangesh$withdraw(-54)
#> Error in self$validate(amount): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
Mangesh <- bankAccountFee$new(name = "Mangesh", balance = -45)
#> Error in self$validate(balance): amount >= 0 is not TRUE
```
