# S4



### Exercises 15.2.1

**Q1.** `lubridate::period()` returns an S4 class. What slots does it have? What class is each slot? What accessors does it provide?

**A1.** Let's first create an instance of `Period` class:


```r
library(lubridate)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'lubridate'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     date, intersect, setdiff, union
x <- lubridate::period(c(2, 43, 6), c("hour", "second", "minute"))
x
#> [1] "2H 6M 43S"
```

It has the following slots:


```r
slotNames(x)
#> [1] ".Data"  "year"   "month"  "day"    "hour"   "minute"
```

Additionally, the base type of each slot (`numeric`) can be seen in `str()` output:


```r
str(x)
#> Formal class 'Period' [package "lubridate"] with 6 slots
#>   ..@ .Data : num 43
#>   ..@ year  : num 0
#>   ..@ month : num 0
#>   ..@ day   : num 0
#>   ..@ hour  : num 2
#>   ..@ minute: num 6
```

The `{lubridate}` package provides accessors to access all of these slots:


```r
year(x)
#> [1] 0
month(x)
#> [1] 0
day(x)
#> [1] 0
hour(x)
#> [1] 2
minute(x)
#> [1] 6
second(x)
#> [1] 43
```

**Q2.** What other ways can you find help for a method? Read `?"?"` and summarise the details.

**A2.** The `"?"` operator allows access to this documentation in three ways. To demonstrate different ways to access documentation, let's define a new `S4` class.


```r
pow <- function(x, exp) c(x, exp)
setGeneric("pow")
#> [1] "pow"
setMethod("pow", c("numeric", "numeric"), function(x, exp) x^exp)
```

Ways to access documentation:

- The general documentation for a generic can be found with `?topic`:


```r
?pow
```

- The expression `type?topic` will look for the overall documentation methods for the function `f`.


```r
?pow # produces the function documentation

methods?pow # looks for the overall methods documentation
```


### Exercises 15.3.6

**Q1.** Extend the Person class with fields to match `utils::person()`. Think about what slots you will need, what class each slot should have, and what you'll need to check in your validity method.

**Q2.** What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn't have any slots? (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.)

**Q3.** Imagine you were going to reimplement factors, dates, and data frames in S4. Sketch out the `setClass()` calls that you would use to define the classes. Think about appropriate `slots` and `prototype`.

### Exercises 15.4.5

**Q1.** Add `age()` accessors for the `Person` class.

**Q2.** In the definition of the generic, why is it necessary to repeat the name of the generic twice?

**Q3.** Why does the `show()` method defined in Section [Show method](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html#show-method) use `is(object)[[1]]`? (Hint: try printing the employee subclass.)

**Q4.** What happens if you define a method with different argument names to the generic?

### Exercises 15.5.5

**Q1.** Draw the method graph for `f(`ðŸ˜…, ðŸ˜½`)`.

**Q2.** Draw the method graph for `f(`ðŸ˜ƒ, ðŸ˜‰, ðŸ˜™`)`.

**Q3.** Take the last example which shows multiple dispatch over two classes that use multiple inheritance. What happens if you define a method for all terminal classes? Why does method dispatch not save us much work here?

### Exercises 15.6.3

**Q1.** What would a full `setOldClass()` definition look like for an ordered factor (i.e. add `slots` and `prototype` the definition above)?

**Q2.** Define a `length` method for the `Person` class.
