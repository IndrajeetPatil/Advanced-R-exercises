# Vectors

## Exercise 3.2.5 

### Q1. Create raw and complex scalars {-}

The raw type holds raw bytes. For example,

```{r}
x <- "A string"

(y <- charToRaw(x))

typeof(y)
```

You can use it to also figure out some encoding issues (both of these are scalars):

```{r}
charToRaw("\"")
charToRaw("”")
```

Complex vectors can be used to represent (surprise!) complex numbers.

Example of a complex scalar:

```{r}
(x <- complex(length.out = 1, real = 1, imaginary = 8))

typeof(x)
```

### Q2. Vector coercion rules {-}

Usually, the more *general* type would take precedence.

```{r}
c(1, FALSE)

c("a", 1)

c(TRUE, 1L)
```

Let's try some more examples.

```{r}
c(1.0, 1L)

c(1.0, "1.0")

c(TRUE, "1.0")
```

### Q3. Comparisons between different types {-}

The coercion in vectors reveal why some of these comparisons return the results that they do.

```{r}
1 == "1"

c(1, "1")
```

```{r}
-1 < FALSE

c(-1, FALSE)
```

```{r}
"one" < 2

c("one", 2)

sort(c("one", 2))
```
